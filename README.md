# -Allowed the player to pick up items and acknoledge if player has item or not.
-Gave the player some sort of statistics, for example, player cannot go through monster without sword.
-Added conditionals to get rid of certain text when player enters a tunnel the second time. Text appears when player hasn't pick up sword yet, but if they do. The text of the sword will disappaer as the game acknowledges the player picked up a sword.
