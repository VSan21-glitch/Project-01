/*
    Project 01
    
    Requirements (for 15 base points)
    - Create an interactive fiction story with at least 8 knots 
    - Create at least one major choice that the player can make
    - Reflect that choice back to the player
    - Include at least one loop
    
    To get a full 20 points, expand upon the game in the following ways
    [+2] Include more than eight passages
    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item
    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)
    
    Make sure to list the items you changed for points in the Readme.md. I cannot guess your intentions!

+[Go Back] -> Dungeon

== Third_Tunnel == 
You decided to take the Third Tunnel. Due to the darkness, you can see that well. Though you think you may have found...something, or maybe nothing. It seems you found a large, gleaming gold chest {not get_coins:and a small, timeworn wooden one}.

*[Open wooden chest] -> get_coins
+[Go Back] -> Dungeon

You killed the monster with the sword but your sword shatters.
~sword = sword - 1
+[Keep going] -> deeper_second

You just got trolled.
-> END
